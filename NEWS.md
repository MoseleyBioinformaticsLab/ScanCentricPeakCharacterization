# ScanCentricPeakCharacterization 0.3.0

* Changed the `SCRaw` class to `SCMzml` class, because I was worried about 
people getting the idea that it could read in an actual Thermo-Fisher **raw** file.
* Updated the `SCCharacterizePeaks` class with more methods that mean that users
don't have to work with the `SCMzml` class directly.

# ScanCentricPeakCharacterization 0.2.20

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

# ScanCentricPeakCharacterization 0.2.0

* Changed the name of the package to better reflect what we are about!
