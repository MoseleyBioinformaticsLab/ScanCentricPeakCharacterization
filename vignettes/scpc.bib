  abstract = {We present a novel, scan-centric method for characterizing peaks from direct injection multi-scan Fourier transform mass spectra of complex samples that utilizes frequency values derived directly from the spacing of raw m/z points in spectral scans. Our peak characterization method utilizes intensity-independent noise removal and normalization of scan-level data to provide a much better fit of relative intensity to natural abundance probabilities for low abundance isotopologues that are not present in all of the acquired scans. Moreover, our method calculates both peak- and scan-specific statistics incorporated within a series of quality control steps that are designed to robustly derive peak centers, intensities, and intensity ratios with their scan-level variances. These cross-scan characterized peaks are suitable for use in our previously published peak assignment methodology, Small Molecule Isotope Resolved Formula Enumeration (SMIRFE).},
