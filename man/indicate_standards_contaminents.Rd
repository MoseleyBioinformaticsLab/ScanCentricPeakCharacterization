\item{zip_dir}{which directories to look for files within}

\item{file_pattern}{what files are we actually using}

\item{blank_pattern}{regex indicating that a sample may be a blank}

\item{save_dir}{where to save the files (default is to overwrite originals)}

NULL nothing is returned, files are overwritten

\description{
Given a directory of characterized samples, attempts to determine which peaks
may be standards or contaminants that should be removed after assignment.
}
\details{
For each sample, the scan level frequencies are read in and converted
to ranges, and then compared with tiled ranges over the whole frequency range.
For those ranges that have 90 to 110\% of scan level peaks in ALL blanks, and
have 10 to 110\% of scan level peaks in at least N-sample - 1, we consider a
possible standard or contaminant. The peak is marked so that it can be removed
by filtering out it's assignments later.
