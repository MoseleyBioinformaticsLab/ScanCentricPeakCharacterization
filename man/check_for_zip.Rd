\description{
ScanCentricPeakCharacterization uses zip files to gather all the pieces of results together,
including the original mzML, binary data file, and JSON files. R can be compiled
on systems where there is no zip function installed.
When it is not installed, it generally creates a permission issue when \code{system2}
tries to call a non-existent command.
This function checks for zip, and warns the user if it can't be found on package load.
If \code{zip} is installed, you may need to set it using \code{Sys.setenv(R_ZIPCMD = 'zip_function')}.
