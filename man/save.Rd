\details{
\code{out_file}, if it is \code{NULL}, will be taken from when the
object was generated, and by default will be set to the same as the \code{in_file}.
If not \code{NULL}, then it is checked that the \code{id} is part of the
\code{out_file}, and if not, the \code{id} is added to the actual file name.
