\usage{
correct_peak(observed_mean, observed_sd, n_observed, n_should_observe)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed_mean}{the observed mean}

\item{observed_sd}{the observed sd}

\item{n_observed}{how many observations went into this mean}

\item{n_should_observe}{how many observations \emph{should} there have been?}
}
\value{
data.frame, with corrected mean and sd
}
\description{
Assuming that an observed mean (intensity) and sd are from a truncated normal distribution
that is truncated on one side only.
