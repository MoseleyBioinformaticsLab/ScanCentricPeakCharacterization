# ScanCentricPeakCharacterization

The goal of the ScanCentricPeakCharacterization package is to facilitate
scan-centric peak characterization of profile level, multi-scan,
direct-injection Fourier-transform mass spectrometry data.

You can read more about the merits of this scan-centric method in:

## Theory

### Converting m/z to Frequency

Outside of the scan-centric nature of this peak-characterization, the
second most important feature is the conversion from m/z to frequency.
This is done to make evenly spaced data. If you acquire Orbitrap / ICR
type mass spectrometry data over any decent range, their is an
increasing spacing between individual m/z points.

We will load up an example direct-injection lipidomics sample acquired
on a Thermo-Fisher Fusion instrument to demonstrate.

``` r
raw_lipid = RawMS$new(system.file("extdata/lipid_example.mzML", package = "ScanCentricPeakCharacterization"))
raw_lipid$extract_raw_data()
raw_lipid$predict_frequency()
```

``` r
raw_lipid$raw_df_data[[1]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(convertable) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mz, y = mean_offset)) +
  geom_point()
```

<img src="man/figures/README-show_spacing-1.png" width="100%" />

We can see here that the difference or offset of m/z points is
increasing with m/z.

In contrast, frequency is defined as the difference over m/z, and
therefore is constant.

![mz\_{mean} = mean(mz\_{p1}, mz\_{p2})](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;mz_%7Bmean%7D%20%3D%20mean%28mz_%7Bp1%7D%2C%20mz_%7Bp2%7D%29 "mz_{mean} = mean(mz_{p1}, mz_{p2})")

![mz\_{diff} = mz\_{p2} - mz\_{p1}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;mz_%7Bdiff%7D%20%3D%20mz_%7Bp2%7D%20-%20mz_%7Bp1%7D "mz_{diff} = mz_{p2} - mz_{p1}")

![frequency = \\frac{mz\_{diff}}{mz\_{mean}}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;frequency%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bmz_%7Bdiff%7D%7D%7Bmz_%7Bmean%7D%7D "frequency = \frac{mz_{diff}}{mz_{mean}}")

``` r
raw_lipid$raw_df_data[[1]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(convertable) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_frequency, y = mean_freq_diff)) +
  geom_point()
```

<img src="man/figures/README-show_frequency-1.png" width="100%" />

However, we can more generally define the conversion of m/z to frequency
using a linear model of the form:

![frequency = a + \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{mz}} + \\frac{z}{\\sqrt\[3\]{mz}}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;frequency%20%3D%20a%20%2B%20%5Cfrac%7By%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7Bmz%7D%7D%20%2B%20%5Cfrac%7Bz%7D%7B%5Csqrt%5B3%5D%7Bmz%7D%7D "frequency = a + \frac{y}{\sqrt{mz}} + \frac{z}{\sqrt[3]{mz}}")

And we can verify that with a plot of the m/z vs frequency and their
predicted values, in a couple of ways, as well as a plot of the
residuals.

``` r
raw_lipid$check_frequency_model()
```

<img src="man/figures/README-show_predictions-1.png" width="100%" />

See the example of `RawMS` below to see how we can change the model
being used.

## Basic Objects and Classes

### RawMS

`RawMS` is responsible for loading the raw data, holding per-scan
metadata, extracting the scan-level m/z and intensity, converting them
to frequency, and filtering any scans out. Although the user should not
have to interact with it much, and **normally** it is controlled by
`CharacterizeMS`, we cover it first here b/c it is useful to instantiate
it at least once per experiment and verify the scan filtering conditions
and the model for converting m/z to frequency.

The default frequency \~ mz model is defined as:

![frequency = a + \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{mz}} + \\frac{z}{\\sqrt\[3\]{mz}}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;frequency%20%3D%20a%20%2B%20%5Cfrac%7By%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7Bmz%7D%7D%20%2B%20%5Cfrac%7Bz%7D%7B%5Csqrt%5B3%5D%7Bmz%7D%7D "frequency = a + \frac{y}{\sqrt{mz}} + \frac{z}{\sqrt[3]{mz}}")

We encode this using the vector:

``` r
freq_vector = c("a.freq" = 0, "y.freq" = -1/2, "z.freq" = -1/3)
freq_vector
#>     a.freq     y.freq     z.freq 
#>  0.0000000 -0.5000000 -0.3333333
```

We can see how this corresponds to the equation above if we transform
the equation to be like this:

![frequency = a + y \\times mz^{\\frac{-1}{2}} + z \\times mz^{\\frac{-1}{3}}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;frequency%20%3D%20a%20%2B%20y%20%5Ctimes%20mz%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7B-1%7D%7B2%7D%7D%20%2B%20z%20%5Ctimes%20mz%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7B-1%7D%7B3%7D%7D "frequency = a + y \times mz^{\frac{-1}{2}} + z \times mz^{\frac{-1}{3}}")

Here we use the **-** to define that it should be a fraction, and the
**1/2** exponent corresponds to the square root.

This is the **default model** that `RawMS` is instantiated with. But
every time you work with a new dataset, you should verify the model
being used is appropriate.

``` r
lipid_1 = RawMS$new(system.file("extdata", "lipid_example.mzML", package = "ScanCentricPeakCharacterization"))
lipid_1$extract_raw_data()
lipid_1$predict_frequency()

lipid_1$check_frequency_model()
```

<img src="man/figures/README-check_model-1.png" width="100%" />

So this model looks right.

What if we mis-define the model?

![frequency = a + x \\times mz^{-1} + y \\times mz^{\\frac{-1}{3}}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;frequency%20%3D%20a%20%2B%20x%20%5Ctimes%20mz%5E%7B-1%7D%20%2B%20y%20%5Ctimes%20mz%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7B-1%7D%7B3%7D%7D "frequency = a + x \times mz^{-1} + y \times mz^{\frac{-1}{3}}")

``` r
alt_model = c("a.freq" = 0, "x.freq" = -1, "y.freq" = -1/3)

lipid_2 = RawMS$new(system.file("extdata", "lipid_example.mzML", package = "ScanCentricPeakCharacterization"),
                    frequency_fit_description = alt_model)
lipid_2$extract_raw_data()
lipid_2$predict_frequency()

lipid_2$check_frequency_model()
```

<img src="man/figures/README-alt_model-1.png" width="100%" />

Here we can see in the residuals (mean\_predicted) that we’ve obviously
mis-defined the model. It’s not obvious from the means vs predictions
that we’ve mis-defined it!
